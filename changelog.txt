		This is good for balance too!

	- Breaching tab on right is relabelled "BREACH AND PROTECTION" for clarity
	- Corrected typo for label on Secondary tab
		"Select secondary weapon and equipment" --> "Select secondary weapon and ammunition"
* Career Menu:
	- Removed "-EXP-" tag before all TSS missions in the menu
* Settings Menu
	- No longer plays music while ingame (only in main menu), so as to eliminate a certain bug
* Graphic Command Interface
	- Performed a drastic redesign of the menu to promote both speed and functionality
		* "Open and ..." commands have been moved to a submenu: "OPEN >>>"
		* "STACK UP" and Optiwand commands have been moved to a submenu: "INVESTIGATE >>>"
		* Due to this design, when viewing a door through another doorway, you can issue both Move and Open commands with no ambiguity.
	- Allowed the player to issue Breaching commands even when doors aren't locked
		* These are available via a new submenu: "BREACH >>>"
	- The GCI is now dynamic in that submenus can only appear in certain contexts (OPEN and BREACH will only show on doors)
	- Deploy Lightstick has been moved out of the Deploy menu (Drop Lightstick command) so they can be dropped faster

========================
Gameplay
========================
* Singleplayer
	- Completely altered the campaign so as to integrate the TSS missions with the SWAT 4 missions linearly
	- Added missing dialogue for "Open and Make Entry" command
	- If one member of a team remains (ie, Jackson is the only one alive on Blue), Lead will say their name instead of their team (so, "Jackson - Mirror Under the door)
	- Stiffened penalties and added new ones:
		* "Incapacitated a Hostage" penalty will now apply if an AI-controlled officer incapacitates a hostage
		* "Killed a Hostage" penalty will now apply if an AI-controlled officer kills a hostage
		* AI-controlled officers may trigger a "Unauthorized use of force" or "Unauthorized use of deadly force" penalty if it was caused by C2

	- Fixed a bug where AI-controlled officers could only drop one lightstick
* SP/CO-OP
