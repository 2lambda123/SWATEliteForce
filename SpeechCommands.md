## HOW TO READ THIS DOCUMENT
This document is best read in a markdown viewer.

Commands that can be issued are in code blocks, for example, the TRY LOCK command can be issued using either of the following:

```
Stack up ...
... the lock ...
```

There are two main keywords that you might see: elipses (...) and the question mark (?)
The elipses are used to denote a wildcard. For example, "Stack up on that door" and "Stack up alongside the door" both work. The elipses can also mean no further words are needed, so simply "Stack up" works.
The question mark is used to denote an optional word. For example, to start issuing orders to blue team, the following command is possible:

```
Blue ?team
```

The word "team" is optional, and you can simply say "Blue" to start addressing blue team. However, if you said "blue coffee," for instance, the game will not understand the command.


## ADDRESSING TEAMS
To start issuing orders to team *gold*, or *element*, try issuing one of the following commands:

```
?As ?an element
All
Everyone
Everybody
Gold
Element
```

To start issuing orders to team *red*, any of the following will work:

```
Red ?Team
Girard's ?Team
Girard ?Team
Reynold's ?Team
Reynold ?Team
```

To start issuing orders to team *blue*, any of the following will work:

```
Blue ?Team
Fields ?Team
Fields's ?Team
Jackson ?Team
Jackson's ?Team
```

To start issuing a hold order (like you would with the CTRL key), the following will work:

```
On my command
On my mark
When I tell you to
On my when
On my order
On my go
On my signal
Wait for my signal, ?and then
```
